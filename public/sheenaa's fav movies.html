<H3>Marley and Me</H3>
<P>I love this movie because it is a rollercoster of emotions. It starts with a happy couple who starts their family by adopting a dog. It's a story about how a pet can change our lives and our perception of seeing life.</P>

<h3>Little Forest</h3>
<p>This movie is about a city girl who goes back to her small hometown for a getaway only to realize how simple living makes her happier. </p>

<h3> Armageddon</h3>
<p>This movie is about saving the world . It is a thriller but also emotional</p>
